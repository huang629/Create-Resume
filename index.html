					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
                    <p>I am a Sophomore in Boston College majoring in computer science and minor in Economic and Finance. 
                        I enjoy trying new things and joy of challenges and solving problems. The thing 
                        that makes my blood pressure soar the most is that mine is encountering a segfault, and at the 
                        same time I would feel like the happiest person in the world only if my code pass.
